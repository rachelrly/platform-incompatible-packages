# Platform Incompatible Packages

This repository contains the source code to accompany my Medium article on utilizing platform-incompatible packages with React Native for Web. 

It does not contain a full React Native project, only the files needed to understand the article.

This tutorial uses [@react-native-community/blur](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/blur).
