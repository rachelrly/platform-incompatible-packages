# Platform Incompatible Packages

This repository contains the source code to accompany my Medium article, [*How to use Platform Specific Packages in React Native and React Native for Web*](https://rachelrly.medium.com/how-to-use-platform-specific-packages-in-react-native-and-react-native-for-web-4a985ec097f0). 

It does not contain a full React Native project, only the files needed to understand the article.

This tutorial uses [@react-native-community/blur](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/blur).
